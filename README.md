# OptimizeMath
With C language to find the opitmized value for the inequation

the input is the factor of the inequality.(stord in the text file, the numbers with a space to separate the value) ,all the equations right part should be positive; the last columns is positive
example : math.txt the first 3 line
number means:
1 : =;
2 : <;
3 : <=;
4 : >;
5 : >=;
1 0 0 3 1000
0 1 0 3 500
0 0 1 3 1500
3 6 2 3 6750

the last line is the the optimized function end with a point"."

1 means min 
2 means max
usual we calculate the max and omit the min
example : math.txt the last line; 
2 4 12 3.
this is means we calculate the max of (4x + 12y + 3z);
